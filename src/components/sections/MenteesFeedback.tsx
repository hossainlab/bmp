Currently, I am working with a professor at my university, which is helping me gain more practical experience. In the past, most of the work around me was done using STATA. However, through your course and research-related guidance, I have been able to learn R and apply it in real work. My professor also appreciated the course and said that my motivation and foundation for learning R analysis came from this training. I am truly grateful for the knowledge and confidence I gained through your course.",
