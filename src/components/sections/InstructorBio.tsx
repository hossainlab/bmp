              Md. Jubayer Hossain is a bioinformatician and computational biologist with five years of experience spanning both active research and teaching. Since 2020, he has trained over 3,000 students — from complete beginners to graduate researchers — in the practical skills required to work with real biological data.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Founder & CEO of DeepBio Ltd, Jubayer combines research rigor with a structured approach to education. His teaching is grounded in what he does daily: designing and running computational analyses on real datasets. Every student in this program works directly with him — not a TA, not a substitute — toward a concrete, submittable research output.
